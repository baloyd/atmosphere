# atmosphere

Atmos allows a user to choose a genre of music and search for accompanying visuals to create a totally unique experience every time.
The problem we are trying to solve is to allow the user to create a personalized experience without video editing knowledge or without requiring the use of multiple apps/browsers to achieve the same goal. 
We used the Spotify and Youtube APIS to retrieve the playlist/video ID information and we used the CSS library Bulma for the styling.
