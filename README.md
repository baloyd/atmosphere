# atmosphere-project

Atmos allows a user to choose a genre of music that they are in the mood for along with searching visuals they would like to see. We used the Spotify and Youtube APIS to achieve this along with the CSS library Bulma.
The problem we are trying to solve with this app is to allow the user to create a personal experience without video editing software or knowledge and without having to use multiple apps to reach the same desired effect.
